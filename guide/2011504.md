# Linking

To link to another zettel, put the <2011403?cf> inside angle brackets[^wikistyle]:

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which links to another zettel:

* <ef3dke98>
```

Such a link instructs neuron to automatically create a connection between the
associated zettels, which ultimately affects the <2017401?cf> of your zettel
graph. In <2011405?cf>, neuron will automatically display the title of the
linked zettel.


## Non-branching links

If your link is merely a reference to another zettel, and you do not wish it to
be part of the <2017401?cf> and the linked zettel's <5e41fd32?cf>, use the
`cf`[^cf] query flag (eg: `<ef3dke98?cf>`). 

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which refers to another zettel without 
strongly linking to it:

* <ef3dke98?cf>
```

Neuron will link the zettels, but the link would be ignored from <2017401?cf>
as well as the <5e41fd32?cf> of zettel with ID "ef3dke98". 

## Advanced linking

[^cf]: 
    > The abbreviation cf. (short for the Latin: *confer/conferatur*, both meaning "compare") is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.)

[^wikistyle]:
    Neuron additionally supports "wiki-style" linking. `[[ef3dke98]]` is the
    same as `<ef3dke98>`. 

    NOTE: This is an **experimental** feature; it will be changed when
    the [Flexible links](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/312) proposal
    gets implemented.
    
    Wiki-style linking was added to allow users to edit their neuron
    notes in existing Zettelkasten software like Zettlr. Note that those software
    may not recognize the full range of Neuron links. See
    [#229](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/229#issuecomment-645756080) for
    details.
