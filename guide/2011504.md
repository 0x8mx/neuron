title: Linking
---

To link to another zettel, using the following syntax:

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which links to another zettel: 

- [2008403](z:). 

You may also annotate the link (ignored by neuron): 

- [2008403](z://foo-bar). 
```

Using `z:` automatically creates a link between the associated zettels, which ultimately affects your zettel graph. If you wish not to add the graph connection (but merely link to it), use `zcf:` instead.

## Other link types

* [2011506](z://zquery)
