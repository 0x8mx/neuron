title: Linking to multiple zettels
---

You may create a query that will list the matching zettels automatically. For example, to include a list of a zettels with the "science" tag (from the example at [2011505](zcf://metadata)):

```markdown
[.](zquery://search?tag=science&linkTheme=withDate)
```

Like `z:` this will affect the zettelkasten graph. If you do not want to affect the graph, use `zcfquery:` instead.
