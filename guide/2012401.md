If you use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), add the following to your `environment.systemPackages` list:


```nix
let src = builtins.fetchGit { url = "https://github.com/srid/neuron"; ref = "master"; }; 
 in import src.outPath { gitRev = src.shortRev; }
```

If you use [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager), add the above to your `home.packages` list.

## Pinning versions

It is generally recommended to pin your imports in Nix. The above expression will fetch the then `master` branch, which is not what you want for reproducibility. Pick a revision from [the commit history](https://github.com/srid/neuron/commits/master), and then use it, for example:

```nix
# This commit revision corresponds to the 0.2.0.0 release tag
let src = builtins.fetchGit { url = "https://github.com/srid/neuron"; rev = "274bcafe85fc2bae0a348ab91818d21c72d786db"; }; 
 in import src.outPath { gitRev = src.shortRev; }
```

In the future if you decide to upgrade neuron, simply change the revision hash to a newer one.
