title: Zettel ID
---

A Zettel ID is an unique identifier that refers to a particular zettel. They are
encoded from the date when that zettel was initially created, and are designed
to be shorter in length.

## Format explained

Neuron uses weekdays in IDs. Consider the following zettel ID: `2008306`. It is
only 7 characters in length, but can uniquely identify a note taken in an
adult's lifetime.

The first two letters, `20`, represent the year (and I'll have to live beyond
age 135 to run out of space here!). The next two, `08`, represent the [week
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) of the year[1](footnote:1). The subsequent
letter, `3`, which can be anything from `1` to `7`, represents the week day.
Finally, the last two letters represent the n'th note taken in that day.

The above example corresponds to the note file `2008306.md` on disk.

## Custom ID

A neuron Zettel ID is typically of the form described above. However a custom ID
is supported as long as it contains only the following characters:

* alphabets 
* digits
* hyphen (`-`)
* underscore (`_`)

  1. Neuron's week number is offset by -1 to ISO week number. It ranges from
     00 - 53. See
