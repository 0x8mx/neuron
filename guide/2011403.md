title: Zettel ID
---

A Zettel ID is an unique identifier that refers to a particular zettel. They are encoded from the date and time when that zettel was initially created, and are designed to be shorter in length.

## Format explained

Neuron uses weekdays in IDs. Consider the following zettel ID: `2008306`. It is only 7 characters in length, but can uniquely identify a note taken in an adult's lifetime.

The first two letters, `20`, represent the year (and I'll have to live beyond age 135 to run out of space here!). The next two, `08`, represent the [week number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) of the year. The subsequent letter, `3`, which can be anything from `1` to `7`, represents the week day. Finally, the last two letters represent the n'th note taken in that day (I don't envision writing more than 100 notes per day; but if I do, I can always upgrade to using alphabetic characters in this location).

The above example corresponds to the note file `2008306.md` on disk.
