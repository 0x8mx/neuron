title: Math support

TODO: Update this for Pandoc AST.

Neuron's Markdown syntax supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

## LaTeX input

You can type LaTeX code in zettels in two ways:

* **Inline**: by surrounding your code with ``` `$ ... $` ```
* **Multi-line block**: 
```markdown
| ```mathjax 
| (A = B) \cong (A \cong B) 
| ```
```

## Examples

* Inline LaTeX when written as ``` `$ \LaTeX $` ``` looks like this: $\LaTeX$

* The multi-line block example shown above will render like this:

$$(A = B) \cong (A \cong B)$$

$$    
\begin{equation}
    x+1 = 2 \\
    y+2 = 3 
\end{equation}
$$

## Limitations

* The `mathjax` code block will treat each line as a separate LaTeX 
  expression. Thus you can't write `\begin{...}` and `\end{...}` on multiple
  lines.
* $$ blocks don't seem to be supported by MMark, it is recommended to
  use `mathjax` fenced code blocks as it correctly escapes other MMark features.
