title: Math support

## LaTeX input

You can type LaTeX code in zettels in two ways:

* Inline: by surrounding your code with \`\$ ... \$\`
* Block: surrounding your LaTeX expression with $$ will display it as a centered block
* Multi-line block: \`\`\`mathjax ... \`\`\`

## Examples

* Inline `$ \LaTeX $` looks like this

* Block:

```mathjax
(A = B) \cong (A \cong B)
```

## Warnings

* The `mathjax` code block will treat each line as a separate LaTeX 
  expression. Thus you can't write `\begin{...}` and `\end{...}` on multiple
  lines.
* $$ blocks don't seem to be supported by MMark, it is recommended to
  use `mathjax` fenced code blocks as it correctly escapes other MMark features.
