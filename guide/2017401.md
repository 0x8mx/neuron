title: Category Tree
---

Neuron allows you to organically build a category tree out of your Zettelkasten graph. This is achieved by <2011504?cf> without the `cf` flag. First, Neuron detects if there are any cycles in your Zettelkasten graph (use `cf` to resolve cycles). Then, it detects all clusters in the graph, and displays a tree view (aka. 'category tree') for each cluster.

The category tree is displayed in the z-index, as well as the connections panel of each zettel.
