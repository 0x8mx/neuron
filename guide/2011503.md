A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), which may be visualized as a forest (a tree with multiple roots). Neuron renders this forest, which may be considered to be an automatic "category tree" that evolves in your Zettelkasten over time. 

## z-index 

The z-index page (at `/z-index.html`; also linked as "All Zettels" in the connection pane) displays your Zettelkasten graph. Zettels that do not belong to the graph will appear under [2012301](z://dangling).

## Connections

Each zettel has a "connection" pane at the bottom. It shows both the outgoing and the incoming links to/from other zettels.
