A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), and <2017401> is a subset of this graph established using special links.

## z-index 

The z-index page (at `/z-index.html`; also linked in the footer) displays your Zettelkasten graph. It detects clusters in the graph, and renders each of them as a forest; see [2012301](z://cluster).

## Connections

Each zettel has a "connection" pane at the bottom. It shows both the children and the parent connections to other zettels (as defined by <2017401> connections), as well the backlinks not part of the tree.
