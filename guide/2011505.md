title: Zettel metadata
---

Every zettel must contain a "title" field in its metadata. Option metadata include "tags" and "date".

## Tags

You can attach one or more tags to your zettels:

```markdown
---
title: Gravity
tags:
  - science
---
```

Tags can also be nested using a "tag/subtag" syntax, to allow a more fine-grained organization of your Zettelkasten, especially when using advanced queries as shown in [2011506](zcf://linking-to-multiple-zettels).

## Date

The creation date of the zettels can be specified in the "date" metadata field (`neuron new` automatically fills in this field):

```markdown
---
title: Ate steak for birthday
date: 2020-04-07
tags:
  - journal
---
```

The creation date can be made to display in a zquery result by using the `linkTheme=withDate` argument (see [2011506](zcf://linking-to-multiple-zettels)).
