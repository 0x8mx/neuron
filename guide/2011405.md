Neuron can generate HTML out of your zettelkasten so that they may be viewed on any other device's web browser. It generates the HTML files under your Zettelkasten, in `.neuron/output/`. If your notes live at `./notes`, neuron will generate the HTML at `./notes/.neuron/output/` as well as spin up a server that will serve that generate site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron -d ~/path/to/your/zettelkasten rib -wS
```

You can override the output directory path using `-o`.
