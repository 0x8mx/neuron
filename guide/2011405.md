Neuron can generate HTML out of your zettelkasten so that they may be viewed on any other device's web browser. It generates the HTML files to a sibling directory of your notes directory. If your notes live at `./notes`, neuron will generate the HTML at `./notes.output/` as well as spin up a server that will serve that generate site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron ./notes rib serve
```

## Graph view

A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), which may be visualized as a forest (a tree with multiple roots). Neuron renders this forest, which may be considered to be an automatic "category tree" that evolves in your Zettelkasten over time. 

### z-index 

The graph is available at the z-index page; for example, see the [z-index](z-index.html) of the very Zettelkasten you are viewing.

### Connections

Each zettel has a "connection" pane at the bottom. It shows both the outgoing and the incoming links to/from other zettels.
