Neuron can generate HTML out of your zettelkasten so that they may be viewed on any other device's web browser. It generates the HTML files to a sibling directory of your notes directory. If your notes live at `./notes`, neuron will generate the HTML at `./notes.output/` as well as spin up a server that will serve that generate site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron ./notes rib serve
```
