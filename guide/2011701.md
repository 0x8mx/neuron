You may configure the parameters of your web interface by adding an optional configuration file named `neuron.dhall` under the notes directory. It should contain:

```json
{ siteTitle =
    "My Zettelkasten for college"
, author =
    Some "John"
, siteBaseUrl =
    Some "https://somecollege.edu/~john/neuron"
}
```
