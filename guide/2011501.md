Neuron can be installed on Linux and macOS using the Nix package manager.

## Prerequisites

First, install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/):

``` bash
bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

Optionally, enable the [Nix cache](https://srid.cachix.org/) if you would like to speed up local builds:

``` bash
# If you do not already have cachix, install it:
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
# Enable nix cache for rib
cachix use srid
```

## Install neuron

Run the following command to build and install the `neuron` executable:

```bash
nix-env -if https://github.com/srid/neuron/tarball/master
```

Alternatively, you may clone the git repository and run `nix-build` on it, which would produce the executable under the `./result/bin/` directory.

## Test your install

Make sure that you can execute the `neuron` executable. You should expect the following:

```bash
$ neuron --help
Usage: neuron NOTESDIR COMMAND
  Zettelkasten based on Rib

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  new                      Create a new zettel
  rib                      Call rib
```
