[Neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron) is a command-line based system for managing your Zettelkasten notes. If you are unfamiliar with Zettelkasten, start here: [2011401](z:/)

Neuron includes a web interface for your notes that update automatically. This very site you are viewing is managed by neuron; and you may access its notes [here](https://github.com/srid/neuron/tree/master/guide). The "zettel" you are viewing currently is called an "overview zettel", and it is named "index"; as the name indicates it provides a portal into the other zettels. 

Neuron also generates a complete index (at [z-index](http://localhost:8080/z-index.html)) of all Zettels visualized as a category tree.

The "connections" panel below provides the outgoing or incoming links to/from other zettels.
