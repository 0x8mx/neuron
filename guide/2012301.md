title: Top-level zettels
---

A top-level zettel from [2011503](zcf://graph-view) is any zettel that has no incoming links (see [2011504](zcf://linking)) from other zettels. They indicate one of the two things:

- Index zettel (a portal into a portion of your Zettelkasten)
- Dangling zettel (a zettel which is yet to be linked to your Zettelkasten).
