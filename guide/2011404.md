title: Zettel Markdown
---

Zettel files are written using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) plain-text syntax. Neuron provides a few extensions on top, notably a way to link to between zettels.

## Linking using `z:`

To link to another zettel, using the following syntax:

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which links to another zettel: 

- [2008403](z:). 

You may also annotate the link (ignored by neuron): 

- [2008403](z://foo-bar). 
```

Using `z:` automatically creates a link between the associated zettels, which ultimately affects your zettel graph. If you wish not to affect the graph, use `zcf:` instead.

## Custom metadata

You zettels can contain custom metadata. Neuron supports "tags" as builtin. For example:

```markdown
---
title: Gravity
tags:
  - science
---
```

## Querying using `zquery:`

You may create a query that will list the matching zettels automatically. For example, to include a list of a zettels with the "science" tag (see above example):

```
[.](zquery://search?tag=science&linkTheme=withDate)
```

Like `z:` this will affect the zettelkasten graph (unless you use `zcfquery:`).
