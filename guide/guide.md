# Guide

Neuron includes a web interface for your notes that update automatically. This very site you are viewing is managed by neuron; and you may access its notes [here](https://github.com/srid/neuron/tree/master/guide). The "zettel" you are viewing currently is conceptually termed an "overview zettel", as it provides a portal into the other zettels. 

Neuron also generates a complete index (at [z-index](./z-index.html)) of *all* Zettels visualized as a [[folgezettel-heterarchy]].

Core concepts:

- [[[id]]]
- [[[markdown]]]

For generating static sites:

- [[[web]]]

For working with your Zettelkasten:

- [[[create]]]
- [[[searching]]]
- [[[query]]]
