# Automatic Publishing

There are various workflows possible to setup **automatic publishing** of your neuron notes. The simplest approach is store your notes on a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo, and use GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions[^this]. You can give this a try instantly using [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template). Follow the instructions in that link to get started.

[^this]: This very site is set up to automatically publish in this manner.

In order to enable automatic publishing for your *existing* neuron site that is already on GitHub, begin by copying neuron-template's [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template/tree/master/.github/workflows) directory to your repository.
