# Automatic Publishing

There are various workflows possible to setup **automatic publishing** of your neuron notes. The simplest approach is store your notes in online repo, and use service like GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions[^this] or GitLab Pages + GitLab CI. You can give this a try instantly using `neuron-template` on [GitHub](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/thematten/neuron-template) respectively. Follow the instructions in those links to get started.

[^this]: This very site is set up to automatically publish in this manner.

In order to enable automatic publishing for your *existing* neuron site that is already on GitHub, begin by copying `neuron-template`'s [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template/tree/master/.github/workflows) directory to your repository. You can do similarly with [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/thematten/neuron-template/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) file on GitLab.
