[**Cerveau**](https://www.cerveau.app/) is a web and mobile app for easy editing and publishing of Neuron notes backed by [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) as storage.

Cerveau is currently in public beta. The pro plan, which allows unlimited notes and private repositories, is available to [Neuron sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/srid) in one of the Cerveau tiers.
