title: Heterarchy & second brain
---

Traditional note taking methods, including outliners (Workflowy, Dynalist) necessitate creation of *predefined* hierarchies, built "top-down". In contrast, the **heterarchy** of Zettelkasten is built organically from "bottom-up". As such - it, being similar to how the neuronal connections are formed, Zettelkasten represents the "second brain".

So even if you 'get it' as soon as you start playing around with the cards, you could reasonably expect to reap much greater gains over a timespan of months or years (at least, that's my experience!).
