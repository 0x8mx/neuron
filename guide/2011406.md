title: Creating and Editing zettels
---

You may use any text editor with Markdown support to edit your zettel files. Neuron provides a command to create new zettel files with the suitable [2011403](zcf://zettel-id):

```
neuron ./notesdir new "My zettel title"
```

This command will print the path to the file created. You may pass it directly to your text editor like this:


```
vim $(neuron ./notesdir new "My zettel title")
```
