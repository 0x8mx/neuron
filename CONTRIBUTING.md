# Contributing to neuron

Contributions are highly appreciated. Please note the following guidelines:

## Autoformatting

I autoformat every Haskell source using [ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu). Before opening a PR you are encouraged to do the same. However if you have trouble installing ormolu for whatever reason, don't let that prevent you from contributing.

## Test your build

Run `nix-build` with your changes to make sure that everything compiles, and the tests succeed.
